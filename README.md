Q1)

1)Abstractions : 
a)distance_list - stores the distances of all the train set data from the test set data.
b)neighbors - stores the k nearest neighbors in the test set 
c)all the other absatractions are given in the initialize function in the class

Ideology:
Knn-
a)By finding the K data points in the training set that are closest to the new data point, and using those K data points to make a prediction. 
For example, in a binary classification task, KNN might predict that a new data point belongs to the "positive" class 
if the majority of the K nearest neighbors belong to the "positive" class.
b)Knn algorithm is also called as Lazy learner because there is no training that happens in the algorithm , it just calculates the distance 
of a test set point to all the train set data points during the testing.


Metrics : 
a)euclidean_distance : It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates 
and y-coordinates of the two points.
b)manhattan_distance :The Manhattan distance is also known as the "taxi cab" or "rectilinear" distance, 
because it is the distance a taxi would have to travel in a city laid out in a grid pattern to get from one point to another. 
It is different from the Euclidean distance, which is the straight-line distance between two points
